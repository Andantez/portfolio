          My love for computers and inquisitive mind stems from a young age
        </h3>
        <p className={aboutDescription}>
          I loved playing games as a child and developed interest in computers
          in general (which got me in trouble with my parents all the time) .
          Much to their annoyance my passion grew stronger and deeper. In recent
          years I had the opportunity to pursue my passion in web development.
